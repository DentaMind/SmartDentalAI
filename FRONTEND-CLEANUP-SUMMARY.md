# Frontend Cleanup Summary - May 2025

## What Changed

The frontend cleanup effort focused on several key improvements:

1. **Consolidated Redundant Code**
   - Moved AI-related components to `frontend/src/features/ai/`
   - Moved patient intake functionality to `frontend/src/features/patientIntake/`
   - Eliminated duplicate code from multiple frontend directories

2. **Feature-Based Organization**
   - Implemented feature-based directory structure for better isolation
   - Each feature now contains its own components, services, and documentation
   - Improved discoverability and maintainability

3. **Improved State Management**
   - Created centralized `AIContext` for AI-related state
   - Properly typed context values for better TypeScript support
   - Clear patterns for state updates

4. **Enhanced TypeScript Support**
   - Fixed numerous TypeScript errors and type definition issues
   - Improved component prop typing
   - Added missing interfaces and types

5. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Added Cypress tests for patient intake flow
   - Created custom Cypress commands for common operations
   - Tests include validation for AI suggestion features

## What Was Preserved

- All original code was backed up to `.backup/frontend-cleanup-20250509/`
- Core functionality and business logic remained unchanged
- API integration patterns were maintained

## Getting Started Post-Cleanup

1. Update your local repository:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Run tests to verify functionality:
   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

## Next Steps

- Expand test coverage to other critical flows
- Continue migrating any remaining components to the feature-based structure
- Update documentation for individual features as needed
