### **Instructions for Fixing the Layout and UI Issues in DentaMind Login Page**

#### **1. Background & Color Contrast Improvements**
- Change the background from the current **light blue** to match the **dark grey color** of the logo. This ensures a **more professional and sleek look** while making other UI elements stand out.
- Adjust the **DentaMind** title color to **white** or a **lighter contrasting color** so it does not blend into the background.
- Keep the **A and I in "DentaMind" subtly highlighted** in a different shade of blue to emphasize the AI aspect.

#### **2. Logo Placement & Scaling**
- The current logo placement at the top **feels disconnected** from the rest of the page. **Move the logo closer to the title or integrate it into the left side near the welcome text.**
- Ensure the logo is properly scaled to **fit naturally** without appearing awkward or out of proportion.

#### **3. Login & Sign-Up Buttons Alignment Fix**
- The **"Sign In" and "Sign Up" buttons are misaligned**, with text **spilling out of their respective boxes**.
- Each button should have **consistent padding and margin spacing**.
- Use **flexbox or grid alignment** to ensure the buttons **fit precisely within their respective containers**.
- Add a **hover effect** with a slight **color darkening** when the user hovers over the buttons.

#### **4. Restore Smiling Woman Image in Bottom Left**
- The previous **image of the smiling woman was removed** from the bottom left. **Restore it** to keep the original balanced look.
- Make sure the image has **rounded edges** or a **subtle shadow** to blend seamlessly into the UI.
- If space feels tight, **slightly decrease the login box width** to accommodate the image properly.

#### **5. Login Box Refinements**
- The input fields (**Username, Password, and Remember Me**) should have:
  - **A cleaner, more minimalistic look** (remove unnecessary borders).
  - **A slight shadow** to create depth.
  - **Rounded corners** that match the overall aesthetic.
- Reduce the **gap between the input fields** to make the form look more compact and cohesive.

#### **6. AI-Powered Clinical Intelligence Box**
- Adjust the **padding and spacing** inside the **"AI-Powered Clinical Intelligence"** box so that the text is well-aligned and does not appear too compressed.
- The **checkmark icon should be centered vertically** with the text.
- Ensure the **font is readable** against the dark background.

#### **7. Bottom Image with Tooth and Loupes**
- **Resize the bottom image** (tooth with loupes) so it fits naturally within its section.
- Add a **subtle drop shadow** to make it stand out while blending smoothly with the background.

#### **8. Overall Page Performance & Responsiveness**
- Ensure all elements **resize properly on different screen sizes**.
- **Fix any flexbox/grid misalignment** to prevent unintended shifts when resizing the window.
- Optimize **loading speed** for images so that they donâ€™t slow down the login page.

**Final Expected Outcome:**  
The page should have **a sleek, professional, and visually balanced layout** with proper contrast, aligned buttons, a restored patient image, a well-positioned logo, and an improved form structure.

Let the AI implement these changes and confirm the updates visually.
