The updated login page improvements are a step in the right direction, but I recommend additional refinements for better usability and aesthetics:

### **Feedback & Additional Enhancements:**
1. **Fix the Congested Wording in the Sign-in Box:**  
   - The text in the tab selection (Sign In, Patient Sign Up, Provider Sign Up, Staff Sign Up) is too cramped. Adding more spacing between the tabs and adjusting the padding will improve clarity.
   - Consider reducing the font size slightly or changing the alignment to center each tab for a cleaner look.

2. **Refine the Input Fields Further:**  
   - The current input fields are improved but could benefit from **slightly larger font size and increased contrast** for better readability.
   - Add a **focus effect** (e.g., a light blue glow or border) when clicking inside the input box for an interactive experience.

3. **Enhance the Login Button for Better CTA (Call to Action):**  
   - The "Login" button should have a stronger **hover effect** (such as a slight brightness increase or a subtle shadow effect) to make it more engaging.
   - Consider making the button **slightly larger** or adding an icon (such as a key or user icon) to improve visual hierarchy.

4. **Address the **CAPTURED PROMISE REJECTION > TypeError {}** Issue:**  
   - This error might indicate a backend issue where the login form isnâ€™t properly handling the sign-in request. It needs debugging before finalizing UI improvements.
   - Ensure that form validation is **properly implemented**, displaying error messages if credentials are incorrect.

5. **Consider Additional Features for a More User-Friendly Experience:**
   - **Show/Hide Password Toggle** (an eye icon in the password field for visibility control).
   - **Forgot Password Link** directly below the password field.
   - **Multi-Step Registration for Sign-Up Options** to avoid information overload on one screen.

Would you like these changes implemented now, or do you want to prioritize fixing the backend error first?
