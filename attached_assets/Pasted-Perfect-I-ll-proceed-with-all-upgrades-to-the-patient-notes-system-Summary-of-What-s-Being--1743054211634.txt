Perfect. I‚Äôll proceed with all upgrades to the patient notes system:

### ‚úÖ Summary of What‚Äôs Being Implemented:
1. **Voice-to-Text AI Integration**  
   - Captures dictations during exams or procedures.
   - Drafts notes from voice inputs in real time.
   - Uses natural language processing to clean and structure content.

2. **Procedure-Linked Templates**
   - Automatically loads the appropriate note template (e.g., comp exam, filling, extraction).
   - Ensures all essential fields are filled: provider, date, procedure, findings, plan, outcome, etc.

3. **Live Note Drafting**
   - Any completed X-ray, chart update, procedure, prescription, or diagnosis will trigger note drafting.
   - Providers see the draft note and must **approve/edit before posting**.

4. **Notes Feed Into AI**
   - Finalized notes automatically feed into the AI system.
   - Diagnostic AI, treatment planning AI, and insurance/finance AI use this data in real time.

5. **Prescriptions + Outcomes Integration**
   - Notes capture prescribed meds, dosages, and whether treatment was accepted or rejected.

6. **Audit Log + Editing Control**
   - All notes are time-stamped and provider-signed.
   - Providers can edit drafts before posting.
   - Finalized notes are version-controlled and stored for audit and compliance.

### üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps I‚Äôll Take:
- Finalize backend schema updates for voice notes, drafts, and approvals.
- Link notes engine to chart actions (X-rays, medical, restorative, perio, treatments).
- Build UI for:
  - Draft viewer & editor
  - Template loader based on procedure
  - Voice-to-text capture widget
- Integrate notes system into:
  - Patient profile
  - AI hub
  - Schedule
  - Treatment tab
  - Finance & insurance review

You‚Äôll be able to see and test each layer once I wire them together. This will make documentation nearly automatic while still giving providers full control.

Would you like to preview the UI mockup first, or shall I proceed with building the backend logic and link the systems?
