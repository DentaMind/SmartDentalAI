Restorative Charting AI for DentaMind
To create a fully interactive and AI-powered restorative charting system, we need a dedicated Restorations Tab in the patient profile. This tab will allow dentists to chart, visualize, and track all existing and new restorations with precise location mapping, animations, and AI-driven treatment suggestions.

1. Core Features of the Restorations Chart
Graphical Representation of All 32 Teeth

Each tooth is shown in multiple views:
Occlusal (top-down)
Buccal/Labial (front-facing)
Lingual/Palatal (back view)
Root Structure (for endodontic treatments)
Teeth should be clickable and interactive for easy selection.
Comprehensive Marking of Restorations

Dentists must be able to specify exact surfaces involved:
Mesial (M)
Distal (D)
Buccal (B)
Lingual (L)
Occlusal (O)
Cervical/Mid-buccal
Root involvement (furcation, RCT)
AI auto-detects common treatment patterns.
2. AI-Driven Auto-Detection and Visualization
A. AI-Recognized Existing Restorations
AI will analyze past X-rays and intraoral scans to detect and mark:

Existing crowns, fillings, bridges, implants.
Previous root canal-treated teeth (RCT).
Defective restorations (fractured, open margins, recurrent decay).
Missing teeth and existing prosthetics.
Once detected, AI automatically color-codes restorations:

Blue: Healthy restorations.
Yellow: Watch areas (possible microleakage, wear).
Red: Defective or failing restorations.
Clicking on a tooth allows the provider to adjust AI-detected findings manually.

B. Animation of Treatment
When a crown, RCT, or filling is charted, AI generates a real-time animation:
Example: If a root canal and crown are added, the tooth will display a pulpal animation of the root canal, followed by a crown being placed on top.
If a filling is marked, the system highlights the specific surfaces (e.g., MO, DO, etc.).
If an implant is charted, it shows an animation of the implant placement in bone.
3. Treatment History & Progress Tracking
Each modification to the chart should be timestamped and linked to:

The date of treatment.
The provider who performed it.
Notes on why the treatment was done.
Follow-up recommendations (e.g., recall visit, re-evaluation).
AI compares old and new charts to detect:

Deterioration of restorations.
New treatment needs.
Patterns of wear and tear.
Fractures, recurrent caries under restorations.
4. AI-Suggested Treatment Planning
AI should automatically suggest treatments based on the chart:

If a filling is marked as failing → AI suggests replacement.
If caries is detected near an existing restoration → AI suggests extending the restoration or doing an inlay/onlay instead.
If a crown is failing → AI evaluates the possibility of re-cementation vs. full replacement.
If multiple missing teeth are marked → AI suggests a bridge, implant, or partial denture based on occlusion.
AI integrates with insurance eligibility to:

Check coverage for suggested treatments.
Predict patient out-of-pocket costs.
Auto-generate CDT codes and pre-authorization forms.
5. Seamless Integration with the Perio Chart & Scheduling
The restorative chart syncs with the perio chart, allowing:

Bone loss tracking around restorations and implants.
Peri-implantitis alerts if inflammation is detected around an implant.
Failure prediction for long-span bridges based on occlusal forces.
AI auto-schedules follow-ups for:

Re-evaluation of questionable restorations.
Crown delivery after impressions.
Implant integration checks.
Occlusal guard fabrication for patients with bruxism.
6. Patient-Friendly Visuals
A "patient view mode" should simplify complex charts with easy-to-understand visuals.
AI should generate before-and-after treatment simulations for case acceptance.
Patients should be able to see their own chart from a portal with:
Explanations of each marked restoration.
AI-generated hygiene recommendations.
Treatment urgency scoring to prioritize care.
7. Final Integration
The restorations chart becomes a central part of the patient record, fully linked to:
Perio charting.
X-rays & 3D imaging.
Treatment planning & financial breakdown.
Automated insurance claims.
AI-assisted patient education tools.
This ensures total efficiency, allowing the dentist to chart, diagnose, and plan treatments seamlessly while maximizing accuracy and patient engagement.
