## **ðŸ”¹ Core Features of the DentaMind Email AI**
### **1. Automatic Email Tracking & Organization**
âœ” **Real-Time Email Parsing**  
- AI must **read, categorize, and store** emails in relevant sections (e.g., lab updates, patient requests, insurance approvals, financial records).  
- Emails are automatically tagged based on **keywords, sender domain, and urgency level**.  

âœ” **Intelligent Email Sorting & Categorization**  
- Emails should be auto-classified into:  
  - **Patient Requests** (appointment inquiries, X-ray requests, insurance updates).  
  - **Insurance & Billing** (claim approvals, denied claims, payments).  
  - **Lab Communications** (case updates, shipping statuses, expected arrival times).  
  - **Internal Office Communication** (staff memos, policy updates).  

âœ” **AI-Powered Smart Inbox**  
- AI highlights **urgent messages** (e.g., insurance denials, patient emergencies).  
- Allows providers to **search emails by patient name, case ID, or treatment type**.  

---

### **2. Automated Patient Communication**
âœ” **AI-Generated Email Responses**  
- AI auto-replies to common requests (e.g., appointment confirmations, follow-up instructions).  
- Customizable email templates for:  
  - Post-op care instructions.  
  - Financial estimates & insurance details.  
  - Prescription refill requests.  

âœ” **Patient Portal Email Integration**  
- Patients can request X-rays, treatment plans, or appointment changes directly through their **DentaMind patient portal**.  
- AI automatically **sends requested files** while logging actions in the patient's chart.  

âœ” **Appointment & Treatment Plan Reminders**  
- AI detects upcoming appointments and **sends reminders via email & SMS**.  
- Customizable reminder frequency (24h before, 48h before, 1 week before).  

---

### **3. Secure File Attachments & Sharing**
âœ” **HIPAA-Compliant Email Attachments**  
- AI **auto-encrypts** sensitive files (X-rays, patient reports) before sending.  
- Only authorized recipients (patients, labs, insurance companies) can access these files.  

âœ” **Auto-Detect Missing Attachments**  
- If an email references an attachment but none are included, AI prompts the sender.  
- Example: **"It looks like you mentioned an X-ray but didnâ€™t attach a file. Would you like to add it?"**  

âœ” **Automatic File Naming & Storage**  
- Incoming lab reports, X-rays, and invoices are renamed following a **structured format** (e.g., `JohnDoe_Xray_2025-03-20.pdf`).  
- Files are **auto-stored in the correct patient chart**.  

---

### **4. Financial & Supply Chain Email Integration**
âœ” **Automated Lab & Supply Order Tracking**  
- AI **reads shipment emails** and updates **ETA for lab cases** inside the **patientâ€™s treatment plan**.  
- If a **lab case is delayed**, AI **reschedules the patient** accordingly.  

âœ” **AI-Generated Supply Orders (DentaMind Supply)**  
- AI detects **low inventory levels** and **automatically drafts supply orders** to preferred vendors.  
- AI can **auto-approve essential supply orders** or flag them for manual review.  

âœ” **Receipt & Invoice Tracking**  
- AI **extracts payment details** from invoices and updates the financial dashboard.  
- AI categorizes **expenses by type** (lab fees, materials, payroll, marketing).  

---

### **5. Insurance & Claims Management**
âœ” **AI-Driven Insurance Pre-Authorization**  
- AI **reads insurance emails** and **updates patient coverage info** in real time.  
- If a treatment is denied, AI **flags it & suggests alternative covered procedures**.  

âœ” **Claims Submission & Follow-Ups**  
- AI **submits claims directly from DentaMind** and tracks **responses**.  
- If a claim is denied, AI automatically **contacts the insurance provider** for an appeal.  

âœ” **Patient Insurance Verification**  
- AI verifies active insurance **via email correspondence with providers**.  
- AI notifies staff of **policy changes or missing information**.  

---

### **6. Email Scheduling & Customization**
âœ” **Time-Based Email Triggers**  
- AI schedules emails for **best patient engagement** (e.g., 8 AM-10 AM & 5 PM-7 PM).  
- Can stagger emails **to prevent inbox overload** for recipients.  

âœ” **Multi-Location Email Handling**  
- If a practice has **multiple locations**, AI ensures emails **route to the correct office**.  

âœ” **Customizable Email Templates**  
- AI-generated email templates should support **dynamic fields** (patient name, appointment date, treatment details).  
- Example:  
  ```
  Subject: Your Upcoming Appointment with DentaMind  
  Hi [Patient Name],  
  This is a reminder that you have an appointment on [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Last Name].  
  Please arrive 10 minutes early and complete any necessary forms online.  
  ```

### **7. AI-Generated Email Analytics**
âœ” **Performance Tracking**  
- AI reports **response rates**, **missed emails**, and **pending replies**.  
- Identifies **bottlenecks** (e.g., frequent patient complaints about billing).  

âœ” **Email Sentiment Analysis**  
- AI **analyzes tone** of patient emails to detect dissatisfaction or urgent concerns.  
- Flags emails needing **immediate human review**.  

âœ” **Click & Engagement Tracking**  
- AI tracks **open rates** and **clicks on email links** (e.g., patient forms, invoices).  
- If a patient doesnâ€™t engage, AI **sends a follow-up message**.  

---

## **ðŸ”¹ How the AI Should Be Coded**
### **1. Email Parsing & Categorization**
- Use **Google API (Gmail, Outlook) IMAP/SMTP** for retrieving emails.  
- Implement **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to classify messages.  
- Store parsed data in **MongoDB/PostgreSQL**, linking to **patients, labs, insurance providers**.  

### **2. Automated Replies & Actions**
- Trigger email replies using **AI-based templating (GPT-like models)**.  
- Implement **cron jobs** for **scheduled email sending & reminders**.  

### **3. File Handling & Encryption**
- Use **AES-256 encryption** for HIPAA compliance.  
- Implement **automated file renaming & storage in AWS S3 / Google Drive API**.  

### **4. AI Email Decision-Making**
- AI must **prioritize emails** based on **urgency & relevance**.  
- Email prioritization factors:  
  - **Urgency Level:** Patient Emergency > Lab Case Delay > Routine Inquiry.  
  - **Response Time:** Immediate (0-1 hr), Same Day (1-8 hrs), Low Priority (24 hrs).

## **ðŸ”¹ Next Steps**
1. **Develop backend API for email integration (IMAP/SMTP setup).**  
2. **Train AI model to classify & prioritize emails (using historical dental email data).**  
3. **Implement auto-response system with AI-generated email replies.**  
4. **Build email tracking dashboard inside DentaMind.**  
5. **Test AIâ€™s ability to process real patient/lab/insurance emails.**
