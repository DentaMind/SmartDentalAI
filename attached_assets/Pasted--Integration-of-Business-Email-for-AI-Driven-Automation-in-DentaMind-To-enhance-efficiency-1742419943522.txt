### **Integration of Business Email for AI-Driven Automation in DentaMind**  

To enhance efficiency and automate workflow, **DentaMind** will integrate **business email connectivity** into the platform. This will allow the **AI to read incoming emails, extract relevant data, and take action automatically.**  

---

## **1. How It Works**
1. **Business Email Syncing**  
   - The DentaMind platform will **connect to the officeâ€™s business email** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.).  
   - AI will **scan incoming emails** for relevant updates (lab cases, insurance claims, patient confirmations).  

2. **AI-Driven Information Extraction**  
   - AI will **identify key details** (patient name, delivery status, time, treatment codes, etc.).  
   - AI will categorize the email based on **type** (e.g., "Lab Case Update," "Insurance Approval," "Patient Reschedule").  

3. **Automated Actions Based on Email Data**  
   - **Lab Cases**: When an email states **"Your case for John Doe will arrive Monday at 2 PM"**, AI will:  
     âœ… **Automatically update the lab tracking section**  
     âœ… **Schedule an appointment reminder for John Doe**  
     âœ… **Notify staff to prepare for case insertion**  

   - **Insurance Claims**: If an insurance email states **"Claim for Jane Smith approved for D4341"**, AI will:  
     âœ… **Mark the treatment as approved** in the patientâ€™s file  
     âœ… **Send a notification to the office staff**  
     âœ… **Schedule the patient for their approved treatment**  

   - **Patient Communications**:  
     âœ… If a patient reschedules via email, AI **updates the schedule automatically**.  
     âœ… If a payment confirmation arrives, AI **marks it as paid and updates the patient balance**.
