Final Competitor Comparison Table
Feature	Competitor AI (Pearl, Overjet, Videa)	DentaMind AI (Our Version)
Caries Detection	✅ Yes	✅ Yes + Progression Tracking
Bone Loss Detection	✅ Yes	✅ Yes + Treatment Forecasting
Fracture Detection	❌ No	✅ Yes
AI Disease Progression Tracking	❌ No	✅ Yes
AI-Guided Sensor Positioning	❌ No	✅ Yes
Automated X-Ray Retake Suggestions	❌ No	✅ Yes

Conclusion: Why This Integration Will Dominate the Market
Most AI systems only detect caries and perio issues → DentaMind AI predicts disease progression and suggests treatment.
Competitors do not integrate intraoral scans & X-rays together → DentaMind merges all imaging data into a comprehensive AI-driven diagnostic system.
Adding a patient education section builds trust → No competitor currently provides radiation safety education inside their software.
AI-driven efficiency (sensor alignment, retake suggestions, auto-charting) saves time → Clinics will save money while improving accuracy.
This integration will set DentaMind apart from any existing AI-driven dental software.
