🦷 Periodontal Charting AI: Proper Display & Usage Instructions
📌 1. Correct Layout Structure
The AI must structure the periodontal chart visually like real perio charts, following these guidelines:

Teeth must be arranged in an arch format, not linear or with unnecessary lines.
Each tooth must display pocket depths, recession, furcation involvement, mobility, and bleeding points at the correct locations.
Gingival margins and probing depths should align properly—do not randomly place values.
Use different colors for bleeding, suppuration, and recession to make interpretation easier.
📌 2. Periodontal Chart Data Points (AI Must Capture These Values)
Each tooth in the perio chart must include:

Pocket Depths (PD) – Three values per tooth (Distal, Mid, Mesial for buccal & lingual).
Recession (GM Recession) – Any gum tissue loss is measured.
Clinical Attachment Loss (CAL) – Pocket Depth + Recession.
Furcation Involvement – Tracked for molars (Class I, II, III).
Bleeding Points (BOP) – Marked in red where present.
Suppuration (Pus/Exudate) – Marked in yellow.
Mobility – Grade I, II, III, must be recorded.
Bone Loss – Percentage-based or measured from CEJ.
Occlusion Notation – Any areas with traumatic occlusion.
🔹 Color coding required:

Red = Bleeding points
Yellow = Suppuration
Blue = Recession
Black dots = Furcation involvement
📌 AI should structure the chart as follows:

Teeth arranged in a maxillary and mandibular format.
Pocket depths displayed in numbers (1–12 mm) in correct locations.
Gingival margin recession should NOT be an arbitrary line but follow real gingival contour.
Ensure a structured grid layout like real perio charting software (i.e., Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Overjet).
🦷 Restorative Charting AI: Proper Display & Structure
📌 1. Proper Layout for Dental Restorations
The AI must NOT create random lines—instead, it should display:

Teeth must be arranged correctly in arch form (Maxillary, Mandibular).
Each tooth should visually represent the existing restorations, caries, fractures, and previous treatments correctly.
Existing crowns, bridges, implants, fillings should be mapped according to standard colors and notation.
📌 2. What the Restorative Chart AI Must Track
Each tooth should include:

Caries (Tooth Decay) – Marked in red.
Existing Fillings – Shown in blue.
Crowns (PFM, Zirconia, Gold, E.max) – Displayed in different colors.
Bridges – Connected structure (pontic properly shown).
Implants – Clearly marked with screw symbol.
Fractures – Highlighted in orange.
Endodontic Treatment (Root Canal) – Root portion colored blue or black.
Missing Teeth – Clearly noted with X or gray-out.
Open Contacts & Overhangs – Clearly marked.
Defective Margins (Restorations with Leakage) – Flagged.
🔹 Color coding required for clarity:

Red = Caries
Blue = Fillings
Yellow = Defective margins (leakage)
Gray = Missing teeth
Black = Root canal treated teeth
📌 AI should display all restorations on a structured, color-coded dental chart resembling traditional digital dental charting (similar to Dentrix, Eaglesoft, or Overjet).

⚠️ What the AI Should NOT Do
🔴 No random, unstructured lines that do not resemble real perio or restorative charts.
🔴 Do not misplace data points—values must be correctly positioned on each tooth.
🔴 No overlapping of furcation involvement, caries, or fractures—each structure must be clearly visible.
🔴 The AI must format the chart to be readable for dentists, resembling actual clinical charting software.

🚀 Next Steps:
Refine AI-generated charts to follow the structure above.
Ensure correct tooth positioning and color coding.
Test AI with sample data to confirm accuracy.
Ensure real-time AI updates properly without unnecessary visual distortions.
