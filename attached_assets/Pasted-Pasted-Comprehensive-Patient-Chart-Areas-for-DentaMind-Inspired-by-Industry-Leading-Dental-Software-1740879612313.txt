## **🔹 Essential Areas for Patient Charts**
These sections will allow **AI-powered automation, better documentation, and improved patient management**.

### **1️⃣ Patient Demographics & Medical History**  
✅ **Basic Patient Information:** Name, DOB, Gender, Contact, Insurance  
✅ **Medical History & Risk Assessment:**  
   - Systemic conditions (Diabetes, Hypertension, Osteoporosis, etc.)  
   - Medication history (AI auto-checks for drug interactions)  
   - Allergies & contraindications (e.g., Latex, Anesthesia)  
✅ **Vitals Tracking:** BP, HR, Oxygen Saturation  
✅ **AI-Generated Medical-Dental Risk Flags**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Cross-check systemic conditions with dental treatment risks, flag contraindications, and suggest treatment modifications.”

### **2️⃣ Perio Charting & Periodontal Assessment**  
✅ **Pocket Depths & Attachment Loss** (Automated voice input for faster charting)  
✅ **Bleeding Points, Suppuration, Furcation Involvement**  
✅ **Bone Loss % (AI Predicts Perio Progression)**  
✅ **Calculus & Plaque Index (Linked to Hygiene Score)**  
✅ **Auto-Generated Perio Treatment Plans** (SRP, Maintenance, Surgery)  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Analyze perio probing depths, bone loss trends, and bleeding scores to diagnose and recommend treatment based on AAP Guidelines.”  

---

### **3️⃣ Radiograph & Imaging Management (AI-Enhanced X-Ray Analysis)**  
✅ **X-Ray Storage & Annotation**  
✅ **AI Detection for Caries, Bone Loss, Abscesses, Fractures, and Impacted Teeth**  
✅ **Comparison Tool (Auto-tracks changes over time)**  
✅ **CBCT & Intraoral Image Integration**  
✅ **AI-Powered Interpretation for Faster Diagnoses**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Analyze radiographs for pathologies, compare historical X-rays, and auto-generate reports with flagged areas of concern.”  

---

### **4️⃣ Clinical Notes & SOAP Documentation**  
✅ **Automated AI-Generated Notes Based on Chart Data**  
✅ **Customizable Macros for Common Procedures**  
✅ **Auto-Summarization of Patient Conversations & Findings**  
✅ **Legal & Compliance-Focused Note Structuring** (Prevents missed documentation for malpractice protection)  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Generate SOAP notes based on today’s patient visit, incorporating perio findings, X-ray results, and treatment recommendations.”
