### **Detailed UI Fixes for the AI to Implement:**
#### **1. Fixing the Image of the Smiling Woman**
✅ **Remove the Dark Overlay**  
- The dark shading over the image **reduces clarity and makes the teeth look less bright**, which is counterproductive for a dental AI system.  
- **Solution:** Remove any dark filters or overlays and keep the image vibrant. If you need contrast, use **a subtle drop shadow effect** instead of darkening the image.

✅ **Maintain Image Brightness**  
- If necessary, **slightly increase brightness and contrast** for a cleaner, whiter look that enhances the focus on the smile.

#### **2. Color & Background Adjustments**
✅ **Background Tweaks for Better Readability**
- The **dotted pattern in the dark background** can either be removed or softened.  
- **Solution:** Instead of small dots, consider a **gradient effect** (subtle dark-to-slightly-lighter blue) for a more modern feel.

✅ **Improve the Blue Panel Contrast**
- The **AI-Powered Clinical Intelligence panel** currently **blends in too much with the background**.
- **Solution:** Lighten the blue slightly or **add a soft drop shadow** to separate it from the background.

#### **3. Login Form Adjustments**
✅ **Fix Misalignment of Sign-In Buttons**
- The **Sign In / Sign Up tabs are misaligned and seem to be overflowing their boxes.**
- **Solution:** Adjust padding and ensure uniform spacing. The tabs should:
  - **Fit neatly within the white card**.
  - **Not overflow outside the bounding box**.
  - Have a **subtle hover effect (light glow or color shift).**

✅ **Enhance the Login Button**
- The **Login button appears a little flat and could use more definition.**
- **Solution:** Add a **mild shadow effect** and adjust padding for **better button clickability**.

✅ **Spacing & Text Field Adjustments**
- The **username and password fields feel too condensed.**
- **Solution:** Increase vertical spacing by a few pixels and make sure the text fields have consistent padding.

#### **4. Layout Adjustments**
✅ **Logo Positioning**
- The **DentaMind logo at the top could be slightly larger** to make it more prominent.
- **Solution:** Increase size slightly and ensure proper centering.

✅ **Header & Text Adjustments**
- **DentaMind title should stand out a little more.**  
- **Solution:** Slightly increase font weight OR add a subtle glow around the text to enhance visibility.

✅ **Balance Content Placement**
- The left section (branding & info) **feels heavier than the right side (login form).**
- **Solution:** Slightly **increase the width of the login card** so it doesn’t feel compressed.
