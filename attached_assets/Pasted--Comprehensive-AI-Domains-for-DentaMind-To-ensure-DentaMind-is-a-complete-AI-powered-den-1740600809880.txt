👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Gather patient history, symptoms, and initial concerns. Distribute case details to relevant AI modules and compile a final treatment plan.”  

---

### **2️⃣ Periodontics AI (Gum & Bone Health)**
- Reads **probing depths, bone loss, bleeding points, and mobility.**  
- Tracks **periodontal disease progression over time.**  
- Generates **AI-powered perio maintenance schedules.**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Analyze perio charting, flag high-risk sites, and generate a perio treatment plan based on AAP guidelines.”  

---

### **3️⃣ Restorative AI (Fillings, Crowns, Fractured Teeth)**
- Detects **caries, fractures, failing restorations** via imaging.  
- Determines if **a restoration needs repair or replacement.**  
- AI tracks **restoration longevity and failure risk.**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Analyze existing restorations, detect caries progression, and determine if restoration failure is likely based on occlusal forces.”  

---

### **4️⃣ Endodontic AI (Root Canal & Pulp Testing)**
- Evaluates **pulp vitality (EPT, thermal, percussion tests).**  
- Detects **periapical lesions** on radiographs.  
- AI suggests **RCT vs. extraction vs. pulp therapy.**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Interpret pulp testing and X-ray findings to determine endodontic treatment needs.”  

---

### **5️⃣ Prosthodontic AI (Removable & Fixed)**
🔹 **Fixed Prosthodontics (Crowns, Bridges)**
- AI evaluates **existing crowns, bridges, implant restorations.**  
- Checks **marginal integrity, occlusal wear, and failure risk.**  

🔹 **Removable Prosthodontics (Dentures, RPDs)**
- AI assesses **edentulous ridges for prosthetic retention.**  
- Tracks **wear patterns, occlusion changes, and adaptation issues.**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Evaluate fixed and removable prosthetics, determine if adjustments or replacements are needed based on function and wear.”  

---

### **6️⃣ Oral Surgery AI (Wisdom Teeth, Pathology, Implants)**
- AI determines **wisdom tooth impaction risk.**  
- Flags **cysts, tumors, and pathology on CBCT/X-rays.**  
- Provides **pre- and post-op recommendations** for extractions.  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Analyze X-rays for surgical extractions, pathologic lesions, and implant placement feasibility.”  

---

### **7️⃣ Imaging AI (X-Ray & CBCT Analysis)**
- Reads **radiographs & CBCT scans for pathology detection.**  
- AI overlays **cavities, fractures, and bone loss** onto images.  
- Tracks **longitudinal changes between images.**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Compare historical and current X-rays to detect progressive conditions and highlight areas of concern.”  

---

### **8️⃣ Orthodontic AI (Growth & Occlusion Analysis)**
- AI evaluates **cephalometric measurements.**  
- Predicts **growth patterns & treatment timing.**  
- Tracks **braces/aligners progress** over time.  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Analyze occlusion and growth patterns to determine orthodontic intervention needs.”  

---

### **9️⃣ Medical History AI (Systemic Risk & Contraindications)**
- AI cross-checks **medical history with dental risks.**  
- Flags **anticoagulant risks (e.g., Coumadin, Eliquis).**  
- Adjusts treatment based on **diabetes, osteoporosis, etc.**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Analyze patient history for systemic disease risks, medication interactions, and contraindications to dental treatment.”  

---

### **🔟 Treatment Planning AI (Final Decision & Case Optimization)**
- AI sequences **treatments based on urgency, insurance, patient needs.**  
- Predicts **patient acceptance likelihood and financial feasibility.**  
- Adjusts based on **time constraints and clinical prioritization.**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Optimize treatment sequencing based on diagnosis urgency, patient finances, and long-term oral health impact.”

## **🔹 AI Communication: How They Work Together**
Each AI module **shares data** with the others to improve accuracy.  

Example Workflow:  
✅ **Patient presents with jaw pain** → **General AI gathers symptoms.**  
✅ **Perio AI detects deep pockets & bone loss** → **Confirms periodontitis.**  
✅ **Imaging AI sees radiolucency at apex** → **Flags potential abscess.**  
✅ **Endo AI checks pulp vitality** → **Determines RCT is needed.**  
✅ **Medical AI checks for diabetes & bleeding risk** → **Adjusts treatment plan.**  
✅ **Treatment Planning AI sequences treatments** based on **urgency, finances, & systemic health.**
