This latest version still has some critical issues that need to be addressed. Here are my updated **detailed fixes and improvements**:

---

### **Key Issues and Required Fixes:**
1. **Login Form Visibility & Contrast Issue:**
   - The login form is **still faded and hard to see**, especially the input fields.
   - **Fix:** Remove the **dark overlay effect** over the right side of the screen so the login form stands out properly.

2. **Color Scheme Refinement:**
   - The **background and card colors are improved**, but the **button and input field colors need refinement**.
   - **Fix:** Change the sign-in buttons and form input fields to a **sleek, consistent** blue tone that **matches the AI-Powered Clinical Intelligence box**.
   - The **sign-in tabs (Sign In, Patient Sign-Up, etc.)** still look too **blended into each other**.
   - **Fix:** Give these buttons a **lighter hover effect** and **defined spacing** so they look more **separated and structured**.

3. **Input Fields (Cannot Type Issue):**
   - The username and password fields **are still not working**.
   - **Fix:** Check if the input fields are **missing their `onChange` handlers or focus state styles**. Also, ensure that `pointer-events: none;` is **not applied to them in CSS**.

4. **DentaMind Logo & Title Adjustments:**
   - The **logo size is better, but the title and logo feel misaligned**.
   - **Fix:** Increase the **logo size slightly** and ensure it is **vertically centered** above the title.

5. **Image Overlay Issue (Smiling Woman):**
   - The **shading overlay is still affecting the image**, making her teeth look darker.
   - **Fix:** Remove **any opacity or overlay effects** applied to this image so her **smile appears natural and bright**.

6. **Login Box Position & Symmetry:**
   - The login box **still feels too pushed to the right** and slightly off-center.
   - **Fix:** Adjust the **grid layout to ensure equal spacing between the left section (info area) and right section (login form)**.

### **Additional UI Enhancements:**
- Ensure that **all buttons have a smooth hover effect** for better interaction.
- Add a **subtle box shadow to the login form** to help separate it from the background.
- Ensure that the **button fonts match the rest of the page typography** for **aesthetic consistency**.

This should create a **cleaner, more functional, and visually appealing login page**. Once the AI implements these changes, send me the next version for review!
