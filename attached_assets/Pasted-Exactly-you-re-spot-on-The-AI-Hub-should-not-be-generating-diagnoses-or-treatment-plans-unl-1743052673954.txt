Exactly — you're spot on.  
The **AI Hub should not be generating diagnoses or treatment plans** unless it's pulling from **accurate, complete patient data**, including:

---

### 🔍 What the AI Hub **should be using**:
1. **X-ray analysis**
   - AI detection of caries, bone loss, crowns, etc.
2. **Medical History**
   - Conditions like diabetes, hypertension, bisphosphonate use, allergies.
3. **Restorative Chart**
   - Existing crowns, fillings, fractures, recurrent decay.
4. **Periodontal Chart**
   - Pocket depths, recession, bleeding, mobility.
5. **Previous Notes & Diagnoses**
   - Past assessments, SOAP notes, failed treatments.
6. **Insurance + Financial Status**
   - To recommend financially viable options.
7. **Scheduling Availability**
   - For AI to intelligently optimize care timing.

### ❗️Why it's working *right now* (but shouldn’t be):
The current AI consensus logic is **simulated or stubbed** — meaning:
- It’s *faking the diagnosis process* for testing.
- It is **not yet actually evaluating** the patient’s perio chart, x-ray annotations, or past dental work.

This is normal early in prototyping — we focused on **getting the UI flow working**, but now it’s time to wire it up to the real backend.

### ✅ What We’ll Fix Next (Proper AI Integration)

We'll update the AI Hub engine to **pull and require real data**:

| Data Source              | Action |
|--------------------------|--------|
| 🦷 **X-rays**              | Require at least 1 analyzed image, or show `AI cannot diagnose without radiographs` |
| 📋 **Medical History**     | Inject systemic risks (e.g. diabetes → perio risk, bisphosphonates → implant contraindication) |
| 🪥 **Perio Chart**         | Analyze pocket depths + bleeding to generate perio stages |
| 🧩 **Restorative Chart**   | Diagnose recurrent decay, defective margins, fractured restorations |
| 📝 **Clinical Notes**      | Extract past issues, pain points, failed RCTs, etc. |
| 💸 **Insurance & Financials** | Influence plan selection (phased, insurance-optimized, gold standard) |

---

### 🔐 AI Consensus Should Then:
- Refuse to run if critical data is missing
- Display *“Missing Information”* warning or block certain AI modules
- Allow doctor override with manual notes input (if needed)

---

### ⚙️ Implementation Plan
1. **Hook AI Hub input logic into `patient_id` full chart fetch**
2. **Require presence of diagnostic inputs before running consensus**
3. **Create fallback UI state when data is incomplete**
4. **Map each AI decision to its source (X-ray, Perio, History, etc.)**

Would you like me to:
- Prioritize integrating **real patient data into the AI Hub**,  
- Or finish syncing the **Patient Directory, Schedule, Labs, and Financial tabs** first?

This is the part where we go from *demo-mode AI* → *true diagnostic intelligence*.
