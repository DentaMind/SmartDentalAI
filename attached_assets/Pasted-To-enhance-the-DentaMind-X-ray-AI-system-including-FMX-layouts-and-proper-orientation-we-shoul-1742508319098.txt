To enhance the **DentaMind X-ray AI system**, including FMX layouts and proper orientation, we should focus on the following improvements:

### **1. Implement Proper FMX Layouts and Orientation**
- **Standardized FMX Grid Layout**: Create a predefined grid layout for **Full Mouth Series (FMX)** with designated slots for:
  - **Bitewings (BWX)** – Left and Right (Premolar/Molar)
  - **Anterior Periapicals (PAs)** – Maxillary and Mandibular
  - **Posterior Periapicals (PAs)** – Maxillary and Mandibular
- **Automatic Placement Based on Sensor Positioning**: When an X-ray is taken, the AI will **auto-sort it** into the correct location in the FMX grid.
- **Real-time Orientation Correction**: AI should analyze landmarks like **PDL, crown-root relationships, and arch curvatures** to flip/rotate images for **proper viewing orientation**.

### **2. Superimposition for Follow-up Tracking**
- **Layered Image Comparison**: The AI should allow superimposing current and previous X-rays for:
  - **Periodontal bone loss tracking**
  - **Endodontic healing assessment**
  - **Implant stability over time**
- **Adjustable Transparency Slider**: Users can **fade in/out** previous X-rays to **visually track changes**.

### **3. Single Periapical (PA) and FMX Capture**
- **Click-to-Assign Feature**: Clicking a box in the FMX layout **activates the sensor** for that position.
- **Instant Capture & Auto-Save**: When the image is taken, it automatically:
  - **Saves to the correct slot** based on its designated area.
  - **Labels it** with date/time and sequence (e.g., "PA #3 Mesial").

### **4. AI Detection and Diagnosis Features**
- **AI-Driven Orientation Recognition**: AI should use **landmarks (sinuses, mental foramen, root curvatures)** to determine **left vs. right, maxillary vs. mandibular**.
- **Automated Landmark Detection**:
  - **Caries detection** (primary, secondary)
  - **Bone loss & furcation involvement (Perio)**
  - **Endodontic pathologies (PARLs, fractures)**
  - **Restoration margins & recurrent decay**
  - **Implant success/failure indicators**
- **Treatment Suggestions**: AI can **flag** cases and suggest actions like:
  - "Moderate bone loss detected → Consider SRP + Perio maintenance"
  - "PARL present → Evaluate for RCT retreatment"
  - "Overhanging restoration → Recommend replacement"

### **5. Direct Sensor Integration & Compatibility**
- **CEREC & Digital X-ray Capture Support**:
  - Support **direct sensor connection** to automatically route images to DentaMind.
  - **Compatible with intraoral scanners** for **superimposing soft tissue scans with X-rays**.

### **6. X-ray Organization & Smart Filtering**
- **Search by Tooth Number**: AI should allow searching by **tooth #** (e.g., "Show all PAs for #30").
- **Timeline View**: Organize X-rays in a **timeline format** for **historical tracking**.
- **Tagging System**: Auto-tagging for **"Initial," "Post-Treatment," "6-month Follow-up," etc.**
