---

### **6️⃣ Restorative Charting & Treatment History**  
✅ **Graphical Odontogram (Color-Coded for Restorations, Caries, Missing Teeth)**  
✅ **Tracking of Fillings, Crowns, Bridges, and Implants**  
✅ **AI-Based Recommendations for Treatment Longevity & Failure Risk Prediction**  
✅ **Auto-Generated Future Treatment Needs Report**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Track previous restorations, flag failing restorations based on wear patterns and AI analysis, and recommend future care needs.”  

---

### **7️⃣ Endodontic & Pulp Vitality Testing Records**  
✅ **AI-Interpreted Pulp Testing (Cold, EPT, Heat, Percussion)**  
✅ **Periapical X-Ray Integration for RCT Needs**  
✅ **Auto-Flagging of Necrotic or Reversible Pulpitis**  
✅ **Treatment Tracking for Root Canals, Pulp Caps, Apicoectomies**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Analyze pulp testing results, cross-check with radiographic findings, and recommend endodontic treatment as needed.”  

---

### **8️⃣ Implant Tracking & Surgical Planning**  
✅ **Pre-Op Planning (CBCT & Bone Density Assessment)**  
✅ **Surgical Guide Design (AI Recommendations for Best Implant Positioning)**  
✅ **Post-Op Monitoring (AI-Analyzed Osseointegration & Stability Checks)**  
✅ **Failure Risk Prediction (Bone Loss, Occlusion Issues)**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Analyze CBCT scans for optimal implant placement, track healing progress, and flag potential complications early.”  

---

### **9️⃣ Orthodontic & Growth Tracking**  
✅ **AI-Assisted Cephalometric Analysis**  
✅ **Growth Prediction for Pediatric & Adolescent Patients**  
✅ **Aligner & Bracket Progress Monitoring**  
✅ **Digital Impressions Integration**  

👉 **How to instruct AI:**  
> “Track orthodontic progress, predict growth patterns, and suggest treatment adjustments based on cephalometric analysis.”
