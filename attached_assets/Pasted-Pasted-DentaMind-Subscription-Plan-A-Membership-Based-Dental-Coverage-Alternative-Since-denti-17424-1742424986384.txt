### **DentaMind Subscription Plan: A Membership-Based Dental Coverage Alternative**  

Since **dentists cannot legally offer traditional insurance plans**, we will structure this as a **membership-based subscription plan** that functions similarly to dental insurance but **bypasses third-party insurers**. This will **increase patient retention**, encourage **preventative care**, and **ensure steady revenue** for practices.  

---

## **1. Structure of the Subscription Plan**
We will offer **multiple tiers** based on the patientâ€™s needs, structured similarly to **concierge medicine models**, but for **dentistry**.

   - 2 routine cleanings per year

## **3. Legal Considerations**
Since **dentists cannot sell insurance**, we ensure:
âœ… **It's a membership, not insurance**  
âœ… **Patients agree to a subscription contract**  
âœ… **Clear disclaimers** that it **only applies to participating providers**  
âœ… **HIPAA compliance** for all stored data  

---

## **4. AI-Driven Marketing & Patient Retention**
### **A. Targeted Digital Marketing**
- AI identifies **high-risk patients** (e.g., frequent emergency visits) and suggests a plan  
- **Automated follow-up emails** for expired plans  
- **Social media & PPC ads** promoting cost savings  

### **B. Referral Incentives**
- Patients get **discounts for referring friends**  
- AI **automates referral tracking** and bonus distribution  

### **C. Teledentistry Expansion**
- AI **screens online consultations**  
- Suggests **in-office vs. remote care**  
- **Urgency detection** (e.g., AI determines if pain is an emergency or can wait)
