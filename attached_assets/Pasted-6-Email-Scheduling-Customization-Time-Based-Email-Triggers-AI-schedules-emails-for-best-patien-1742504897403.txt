6. Email Scheduling & Customization
âœ” Time-Based Email Triggers

AI schedules emails for best patient engagement (e.g., 8 AM-10 AM & 5 PM-7 PM).
Can stagger emails to prevent inbox overload for recipients.
âœ” Multi-Location Email Handling

If a practice has multiple locations, AI ensures emails route to the correct office.
âœ” Customizable Email Templates

AI-generated email templates should support dynamic fields (patient name, appointment date, treatment details).
Example:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
Subject: Your Upcoming Appointment with DentaMind  
Hi [Patient Name],  
This is a reminder that you have an appointment on [Date] at [Time] with Dr. [Last Name].  
Please arrive 10 minutes early and complete any necessary forms online.  
7. AI-Generated Email Analytics
âœ” Performance Tracking

AI reports response rates, missed emails, and pending replies.
Identifies bottlenecks (e.g., frequent patient complaints about billing).
âœ” Email Sentiment Analysis

AI analyzes tone of patient emails to detect dissatisfaction or urgent concerns.
Flags emails needing immediate human review.
âœ” Click & Engagement Tracking

AI tracks open rates and clicks on email links (e.g., patient forms, invoices).
If a patient doesnâ€™t engage, AI sends a follow-up message.
ðŸ”¹ How the AI Should Be Coded
1. Email Parsing & Categorization
Use Google API (Gmail, Outlook) IMAP/SMTP for retrieving emails.
Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify messages.
Store parsed data in MongoDB/PostgreSQL, linking to patients, labs, insurance providers.
2. Automated Replies & Actions
Trigger email replies using AI-based templating (GPT-like models).
Implement cron jobs for scheduled email sending & reminders.
3. File Handling & Encryption
Use AES-256 encryption for HIPAA compliance.
Implement automated file renaming & storage in AWS S3 / Google Drive API.
4. AI Email Decision-Making
AI must prioritize emails based on urgency & relevance.
Email prioritization factors:
Urgency Level: Patient Emergency > Lab Case Delay > Routine Inquiry.
Response Time: Immediate (0-1 hr), Same Day (1-8 hrs), Low Priority (24 hrs).
ðŸ”¹ Next Steps
Develop backend API for email integration (IMAP/SMTP setup).
Train AI model to classify & prioritize emails (using historical dental email data).
Implement auto-response system with AI-generated email replies.
Build email tracking dashboard inside DentaMind.
Test AIâ€™s ability to process real patient/lab/insurance emails.
This will ensure DentaMindâ€™s AI-driven email system fully automates patient communication, lab coordination, financial tracking, and insurance management. Would you like any additional features included?
