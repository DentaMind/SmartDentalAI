**DentaMind Expansion: UI/UX Wireframe & Technical Roadmap**

## **I. UI/UX Wireframe Overview**
### **1. Lab & Supply Ordering System**
**New Tab:** "Labs & Supplies"
- **Dashboard Sections:**
  - *Order Supplies*: Search & order materials from vendors or DentaMind Supply.
  - *Inventory Tracker*: AI-powered stock monitoring & alerts.
  - *Upload Receipts*: AI scans receipts and logs expenses.
  - *Lab Case Tracking*: Monitor progress of lab work in real time.
  
**User Workflow:**
1. Dentist clicks "Labs & Supplies."
2. Chooses between "Order from Vendor" or "DentaMind Supply."
3. If ordering from **DentaMind Supply**, AI suggests recommended purchases based on usage trends.
4. For **inventory management**, AI flags low-stock items and auto-recommends restocking.
5. Users can upload receipts (scanned or photo), and AI extracts expense details.
6. Lab case submissions show **real-time updates** (e.g., "In Progress," "Shipped," "Received").

### **2. DentaMind Supply Dropshipping System**
**New Integration:** "DentaMind Supply"
- **User Workflow:**
  1. Practice orders directly through the platform.
  2. AI suggests optimized bulk purchasing.
  3. API connects with manufacturers for direct shipping.
  4. AI tracks cost vs. revenue impact per order.
  
**Backend Integration:**
- Implement API connections to suppliers (e.g., Henry Schein, Patterson, Benco).
- Develop **dynamic price comparison** between vendors.
- AI predicts **future supply needs based on past ordering trends.**
- Build a **secure payment portal for streamlined transactions.**

### **3. Orthodontic Telehealth System**
**New Tab:** "Orthodontic Care"
- **Patient Sections:**
  - *Submit Progress Photos*: Patients upload photos/scans for AI assessment.
  - *Telehealth Follow-Ups*: Automated & live virtual consults.
  - *Aligner Shipment Tracking*: AI predicts treatment stage & schedules deliveries.

**User Workflow:**
1. Patients upload **progress photos/scans** from their phone.
2. AI **analyzes tooth movement** and checks compliance.
3. If progress is **on track**, AI schedules next aligner shipment.
4. If **deviations occur**, AI flags for manual review or in-person consult.
5. Telehealth consultations allow clinicians to adjust treatment plans remotely.
6. AI reminds patients of compliance (wear time, elastics usage).
