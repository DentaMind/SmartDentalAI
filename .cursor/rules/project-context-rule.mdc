# DentaMind Context Rule

This project is DentaMind â€” an AI-powered dental diagnostic and practice management platform.

It uses:
- FastAPI for backend (`backend/api`)
- React (TypeScript) for frontend (`frontend/`)
- PostgreSQL as the database
- Alembic for managing database migrations
- Pydantic models and strict typing for data validation
- Roboflow for dental image analysis and diagnosis

When suggesting code edits:
- Always follow RESTful API conventions
- Keep schema and migrations in sync
- Never suggest raw SQL unless explicitly needed
- Backend modules are under `backend/api`, models in `backend/api/database.py`
