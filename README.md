# DentaMind AI

## 🧠 Overview
DentaMind is an AI-driven diagnostic platform for dentistry and medicine. It links imaging, charting, patient records, scheduling, financials, treatment planning, insurance handling, and AI feedback-based diagnosis into one unified system.

## 🎯 Goal
Build an advanced AI assistant that connects all modules and continuously improves through feedback-based learning. The AI should reason like a senior general dentist and developer.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `models/imaging_ai`: X-ray, CBCT, MRI AI training and prediction
- `roboflow`: Image datasets and Roboflow integration
- `feedback_system`: Interfaces and backend for doctor feedback training
- `api`: FastAPI or Flask-based endpoints
- `data/raw`: Uploaded medical data (unprocessed)
- `data/processed`: Cleaned and transformed data
- `notebooks`: Experiments and model training walkthroughs
- `utils`: Reusable code for preprocessing, analysis, helpers

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Activate your virtual environment
3. Install requirements:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the app:
   `python3 main.py`

## 🤖 AI Agents
- SmartDentalAI: Core platform
- CodeGPT Agent: Assists development inside VS Code
- Roboflow AI: Handles object detection on dental imaging

## 🔁 Feedback Learning
- Doctor feedback triggers retraining loops
- AI models improve accuracy over time using real case data

## ✅ Next Steps
- Expand the dataset (minimum 1000+ images)
- Link diagnosis engine with X-ray + clinical chart
- Automate documentation, coding, and claims
