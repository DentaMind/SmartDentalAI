    "content": "Pulp vitality testing includes thermal tests (cold, heat), electric pulp testing, and direct dentin stimulation. Cold tests using refrigerant spray or ice are most commonly used for initial testing. A lingering pain response (>10 seconds) to cold suggests irreversible pulpitis, while no response suggests pulp necrosis. These tests should be used in conjunction with radiographic and clinical findings.",
