    "content": "Periodontal probes are calibrated instruments used to measure pocket depths around teeth. The WHO probe has a 0.5mm ball tip and markings at 3.5, 5.5, 8.5, and 11.5mm. The UNC-15 probe has 1mm markings to 15mm and is often used in research and for comprehensive periodontal assessment. Proper probing technique involves inserting the probe with gentle pressure (20-25g force) parallel to the long axis of the tooth.",
