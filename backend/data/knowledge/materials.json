    "content": "Glass ionomer cements are water-based materials that bond chemically to tooth structure and release fluoride. They have properties intermediate between dental cements and dental restorative materials. Advantages include chemical adhesion to tooth structure, fluoride release, and thermal expansion similar to tooth structure. Disadvantages include low fracture resistance and poor aesthetics compared to composite resins.",
