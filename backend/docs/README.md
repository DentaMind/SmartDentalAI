# DentaMind API Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the DentaMind API, including implementation details, validation results, and architecture decisions.

## Available Documentation

- [Patient Data Encryption Validation](./patient_encryption_validation.md): Validation results for the field-level encryption system used to protect sensitive patient data.

## Technical Areas

### Security and Privacy

The DentaMind system implements several security measures to protect patient data:

1. **Field-level Encryption**: Sensitive patient data is encrypted at the field level before storage in the database.
2. **Role-based Access Control**: All API endpoints enforce appropriate permissions and role checks.
3. **Audit Logging**: System actions involving PHI are logged for compliance and security monitoring.

### Database Migration System

The database migration system has been enhanced with:

1. **Environment-aware Migrations**: Migrations are tagged with environment restrictions (development, staging, production).
2. **Database Integrity Health Checks**: Regular checks verify database tables, foreign keys, and indexes for integrity issues.
3. **Migration Rollback CLI**: Safe rollback procedures with database backups, SQL previews, and confirmation steps.
4. **Alerting**: Notifications for migration failures and integrity issues.

## Architecture Decisions

Key architecture decisions are documented to provide context and rationale for implementation choices. Current documented decisions include:

1. Use of SQLAlchemy ORM with TypeDecorators for transparent field encryption
2. Environment-aware database migrations
3. Separation of API routes by functional domain

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding new features or making significant changes to the system, please update or add documentation in this directory. Documentation should include:

- Implementation details
- Architecture decisions and rationales
- Configuration requirements
- API endpoints (if applicable)
- Security considerations
